# Michael's Solution to Max.ng test
Thank you for this code challenge

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm test -- --watch
```



## Question 1. Observations
 Kindly note that there are age differences in my result and the expected For exapmple Paul is meant to be 116 years but the expected result shows 117
 This change has created a disperity in the expected result 

 Also the expected outcome in the TDD is slightly different from what the question requested for example the question didn't require dob as objects passed in the members array
