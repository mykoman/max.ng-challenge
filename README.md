Thank you for this code challenge

#Question 1.
 Kindly note that there are age differences in my result and the expected For exapmple Paul is meant to be 116 years but the expected shows 117
 This change has created a disperity in the expected result
 Also the expected outcome is slightly differnet from what the question requested for example the question didn't require dob as objects passed in the members array
